Hey there, Jeremy from uncombo here. Thanks so much for taking some time to check out the site! I’ve been playing video games since I was a kid, loved building websites since my high school web design course, and recently found a new hobby in retro gaming handhelds, so creating this blog felt like a natural next step. The goal here is really simple: enjoy my hobbies while creating some useful content to help others enjoy and discover these hobbies as well. I often find myself scrolling through countless Youtube videos and Reddit posts looking for software how-to’s and device buying guides. The information is out there, but it’s not always easy to find. I hope this blog can become a comprehensive gamer’s resource with everything I’ve learned (and will continue to learn) over the years. Enjoy!
