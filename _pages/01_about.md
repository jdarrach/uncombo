Hey there, Jeremy from uncombo here. Thanks so much for taking some time to check out the site! I’ve been playing video games since I was a kid, loved building websites since my high school web design course, and recently found a new hobby in retro gaming handhelds, so creating this blog felt like a natural next step. The goal here is really simple: enjoy my hobbies while creating some useful content to help others enjoy and discover these hobbies as well. I’ve found myself scrolling through countless Youtube videos and Reddit posts in the past looking for software how-to’s and device buying guides. The information is out there, but it’s not always easy to find. I hope this blog can become a comprehensive gamer’s resource with everything I’ve learned (and will continue to learn) over the years.
